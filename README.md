###Overview.
This Python program calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. It prompts the user to enter the original price and a discount percentage. If the discount is 20% or higher, the program applies the discount and shows the reduced price. If the discount is less than 20%, it returns the original price. The program handles invalid inputs (like letters or symbols) gracefully to prevent crashes.
Think of it like a toy store cashier who checks if a sale is big enough to lower the price and tells you how much you’ll pay!
